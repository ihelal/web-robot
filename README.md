Web interface for the Ruby Robot

Currently under development this allows control of the Ruby robot through a web interface on a mobile phone or computer.

WARNING
=======
This needs to run as root and as such has full access to your computer. 
I have written the code to check for appropriate input, but does not have the same security validation that would be required for a production environment.

The only security authentication required is the security provided by the Wireless network configuration (recommended WPA or WPA2). 

This is designed for use with the Ruby Robot "educational toy" and should not be run on a production computer or connected to a public network.
